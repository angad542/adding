## PROJECT OVERVIEW: 

Our project integrates a web-based e-commerce platform with Walmart, with a focus on sustainability and environmentally friendly products.

## Key Objectives
- Green Product Section: Provide a dedicated section for green and eco-friendly products, allowing users to browse and shop for sustainable items easily.
